# OpenCV-Frame-Splitting-Video-Masking
Contains software to mask an image and split a video into frames.

These projects were tests for startup ideas that did not go far.  One was to split videos in order to then do web searchs on the individual frames.  The other was to mask an image with an indelible digital watermark.  The indelible digital watermark is proprietary and not included in this software.  The software is written in python 3.

The maskImage software requires an input image.  Change the name in the script to whatever picture you have.  The program also requires a prime number as a text file.  This file is provided in the release and the name starts with "M" followed by a number.  The name indicates the exponent for the Mersenne prime number.
